## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi! I'm Candice Wang, a passionate computer science student interested in machine learning, data visualization, and human-centered AI. I love building projects that make data fun and interactive.

## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

### [Alcohol DIY Generator](https://github.com/candicewangtiancan/Alcohol_DIY_Generator_Project)
An interactive cocktail recommendation tool powered by TheCocktailDB API. Users can explore drinks based on ingredients, compare options via A/B testing, and receive personalized suggestions based on their preferences.

- **Features:** Multi-tab UI, image-based drink results, A/B preference tracking, personalized drink suggestions
- **Visualization:** Dynamic charts for user preference trends (glass type, alcohol, ingredients)
- **Tech Used:** `ipywidgets`, `pandas`, `requests`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `Jupyter`

### [Emotion Classification of Natural Language](https://github.com/candicewangtiancan/Emotion_Classification_Project)
An NLP project for classifying emotional tone in text using machine learning. Developed as part of CS 3780/5780, this project compares traditional CNN + Bag-of-Words with the transformer-based DistilBERT model.

- **Best Model:** DistilBERT (accuracy 0.77, above baseline)
- **Techniques:** Supervised learning, feature extraction, transformer embeddings
- **Tech Used:** `pandas`, `PyTorch`, `Transformers`, `Jupyter`

### [College Performance Classification](https://github.com/candicewangtiancan/College_Performance_Classification)
A graduate group project from STSCI 5954 that analyzes data from 777 U.S. colleges and universities. Using exploratory data analysis and machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest), the project classifies institutions as elite or non-elite based on performance metrics like application rates, graduation rates, and alumni donations.

- **Best Model:** Random Forest (highest accuracy and ROC AUC)
- **Key Insights:** Importance of out-of-state tuition, academic reputation, and student services
- **Tech Used:** `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `Jupyter`
